# PocketRogue
My incomplete 2D RPG targeting both desktop and android runtimes. Game is built using LibGDX (Java game framework that is backed by OpenGL for graphics capability). The game features separate control schemes for android and desktop.

Key features of the code base include:  
-Entity component system.  
-Message system for communicating between objects.  
-Loading of item definitions from JSON files.  
-Custom GUI system leveraging existing LibGDX GUI classes.
